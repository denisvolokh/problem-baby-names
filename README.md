# Baby Names Problem

Each year, the goverment releases a list of the 10000 most common baby names and their frequencies 
(the number of babies with that name). The only problem with this is that some names have multiple spellings.
For example, "John" and "Jon" are essentially the same name but would be listed separately in the list.

Given two lists, one of names/frequencies and the other of pair equivalent names. Write an algorithm to print a new list of the true frequency of each names.
